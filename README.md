This is a minesweeper game built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

I built this game with the help of Ania Kubow tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0No1JDc6vE&list=WL&index=38&ab_channel=TraversyMedia)

you can clone the game and run it on your browser or play the live demo [here](https://khaled5321.github.io/mine-sweeper/)
